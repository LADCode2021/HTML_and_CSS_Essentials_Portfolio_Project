                <p>Welcome to First Photography. We work closely with clients to ensure they have lasting memories of
                    new additions to their families
                    with a professional look and feel. We have experience shooting cake smashes, newborn shoots,
                    religious and naming ceremonies,
                    family portraits and many more special moments.</p>
                <p>We are based in the South West of England but are happy to travel for the right projects!</p>
