            <p>Welcome to First Photography. My name is John Smith and I am an experienced photographer specialising in capturing those first 
                special moments with your new family member!</p>
            <p>My aim is to work with my clients to ensure you have lasting memories of your new additions with a professional look and feel. My passion 
                comes from having children of my own and being forever grateful that my families first moments were captured. 
                These photographs are some of my most cherished possessions.</p>
            <p>When you look at my gallery page you will see many examples of: cake smashes, newborn shoots, religious and naming ceremonies, 
                family portraits and many more special moments.</p>
