                    <p class="section-paragraph">Welcome to First Photography. We work closely with clients to
                        ensure
                        they
                        have lasting memories
                        of
                        new additions to their families
                        with a professional look and feel. We have experience shooting cake smashes, newborn shoots,
                        religious and naming ceremonies,
                        family portraits and many more special moments. We are based in the South West of England but
                        are happy to travel

                    <p>My name is John Smith and I am an experienced photographer specialising in capturing those
                        first
                        special moments with your new family member!
                        My passion comes from having children of my own and being forever
                        grateful that my families first moments were captured.</p>
